# :scroll: AWS-MULTI-AGENT-COLLABORATION-DEMO :scroll:

Multi Agent DEMO on AWS, serving as a bank supervisor agent that contains the following entities:

- Financial Products Agent:

  - Action Group: with connectivity to financial products (DB-based)

- Financial Assistant Agent:

  - Action Group: with access to latest market insights (API-based)
  - Knowledge Base: with access to all bank's products (OpenSearch + S3-based)

This DEMO enables the collaboration of agents via the [multi-agent-collaboration-capability](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-multi-agent-collaboration-capability-for-amazon-bedrock/) for Bedrock released on re:Invent 2024.

## Manual Steps

As Bedrock Agents are newly released, not ALL the necessary AWS-SKDs and CDK/CloudFormation constructs/resources are available. Thus, I created the "manual guide" for the last steps needed to run this demo (just a couple steps for now).
